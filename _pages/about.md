Hello! Friends from afar! I'm Chen Buhuan. As for my original name, let's keep that mysterious for now! This is my personal homepage. Since September 2025, I will be pursuing a Ph.D. in Statistics at Beijing Normal University. 

Building this personal homepage has been a long-cherished wish of mine. Previously, due to a lack of content accumulation and sufficient time, the plan had been put on hold. In the future, I will take good care of this space. On the one hand, I want to use it to record the bits and pieces of my scientific research life. On the other hand, I also hope to open-source and share the theoretical knowledge and technical methods I have learned. This is not only convenient for me to look up at any time but also can benefit more people.After all, recording what I have learned is also a good way to consolidate my knowledge.

 If you are interested in my research, you are welcome to contact me via Email. I am really looking forward to communicating and discussing with you! However, if you just want to pick a fight, please go elsewhere. I'm not good at arguing, and I always feel extremely exhausted after every argument. 

In addition to focusing on academic research, my life is also quite colorful. I am keen on playing Texas Hold'em poker, mahjong, and guandan in my daily life. I am also never stingy in appreciating beautiful things, such as beautiful scenery and elegant ladies. Among all my hobbies, the one that gives me the most pleasure is making friends. During my time on campus, I especially like chatting with a group of professors over 50 years old who have rich experiences. They are like walking encyclopedias. Chatting with them about the philosophy of life and discussing future prospects, every clash of ideas can bring me new inspiration. Don't even think about playing any small tricks of fraud on me! I'm very smart! When I encounter something I'm not sure about, I like to seek advice from these old professors who are like my "think tank". With the support of their experience, ordinary little tricks can't deceive me.

There are still many things left unsaid and stories yet to be shared. Let's save them and chat about them slowly on my blog! Haha!



您好！远方的朋友！我是陈不奂，至于原名，就先保留这份神秘感啦~这是我的个人主页。自2025年9月起，我即将在北京师范大学攻读统计学博士学位。 

搭建这个个人主页，是我长久以来的心愿。此前，因缺乏内容积累与充足时间，计划一直搁置。未来，我会用心经营这个空间：一方面，想借此记录科研生活的点滴；另一方面，也希望将所学的理论知识、技术方法开源共享，既方便自己随时查阅，也能让更多人受益——毕竟，把学到的东西记录下来，也是巩固知识的好方法。 

倘若您对我的研究感兴趣，欢迎通过Email与我联系，我十分期待与您交流探讨！不过，要是您只想来“抬杠”，那还请绕道而行~我并不擅长争论，每次争论过后都会感到疲惫不堪。 

除了专注学术研究，我的生活也相当丰富多彩，平日里热衷德州扑克、搓麻将、玩掼蛋，也从不吝啬对美好事物的欣赏，比如欣赏美丽的风景与优雅的佳人。不过在众多爱好里，最让我乐此不疲的还是结交朋友。在校园时光里，我尤其喜欢和一群50岁往上、阅历丰富的老教授们谈天说地。他们就像一本本行走的百科全书，与他们畅谈人生哲理、共话未来图景，每一次思想的交锋都能让我收获全新的启发。 

可别想着在我这儿耍什么诈骗的小伎俩！我可机灵着呢！遇到拿捏不准的事儿，我就爱向这些“智囊团”老教授们取取经，有他们的经验加持，一般的小套路可糊弄不了我。 

更多未说完的话、未分享的故事，咱们就留到博客里慢慢唠吧！哈哈！
