Greetings! Dear friends from afar! I'm Chen Buhuan. As for my given name, I'd like to maintain an air of mystery for now. Welcome to my personal website. Come September 2025, I will commence my pursuit of a Ph.D. in Statistics at Beijing Normal University. 

Creating this personal website has been a long-anticipated aspiration of mine. In the past, due to insufficient content reserves and time constraints, the plan remained in abeyance. Going forward, I am committed to meticulously curating this digital space. On one hand, it will serve as a chronicle of my academic journey, capturing the nuances of my research endeavors. On the other hand, I aim to make the theoretical knowledge and technical methodologies I acquire publicly accessible. This practice not only facilitates my own review but also extends the benefits to a broader audience. After all, documenting learned material is an effective means of reinforcing comprehension and retention. 

Should you find my research intriguing, I warmly invite you to reach out via email. I eagerly anticipate engaging in intellectual exchanges with you. However, if your intention is merely to engage in unproductive debates, I must kindly ask you to refrain. I am not adept at confrontational discussions, and such exchanges invariably leave me feeling drained. 

Beyond my academic pursuits, my life is replete with diverse interests. I have a penchant for recreational activities such as Texas Hold'em poker, mahjong, and guandan. I also take great delight in appreciating the beauty of nature and the elegance of individuals. Among all my pastimes, my greatest passion lies in forging new friendships. During my time at university, I particularly relish conversations with professors aged 50 and above. Their wealth of experience makes them living repositories of knowledge. Engaging in discussions about life's philosophy and envisioning future possibilities with them invariably sparks novel insights, as each intellectual discourse serves as a wellspring of inspiration. 

Rest assured, any attempts at deception will prove futile. I'm quite perceptive when it comes to such matters. Whenever faced with uncertainties, I turn to these seasoned professors for counsel. With their guidance and accumulated wisdom, I'm well-equipped to see through common scams and tricks. There are countless untold stories and unshared anecdotes that await exploration. 

I look forward to delving into them with you through my blog. Let the conversations begin! 



您好！远方的朋友！我是陈不奂，至于原名，就先保留这份神秘感啦~这是我的个人主页。自2025年9月起，我即将在北京师范大学攻读统计学博士学位。 

搭建这个个人主页，是我长久以来的心愿。此前，因缺乏内容积累与充足时间，计划一直搁置。未来，我会用心经营这个空间：一方面，想借此记录科研生活的点滴；另一方面，也希望将所学的理论知识、技术方法开源共享，既方便自己随时查阅，也能让更多人受益——毕竟，把学到的东西记录下来，也是巩固知识的好方法。 

倘若您对我的研究感兴趣，欢迎通过Email与我联系，我十分期待与您交流探讨！不过，要是您只想来“抬杠”，那还请绕道而行~我并不擅长争论，每次争论过后都会感到疲惫不堪。 

除了专注学术研究，我的生活也相当丰富多彩，平日里热衷德州扑克、搓麻将、玩掼蛋，也从不吝啬对美好事物的欣赏，比如欣赏美丽的风景与优雅的佳人。不过在众多爱好里，最让我乐此不疲的还是结交朋友。在校园时光里，我尤其喜欢和一群50岁往上、阅历丰富的老教授们谈天说地。他们就像一本本行走的百科全书，与他们畅谈人生哲理、共话未来图景，每一次思想的交锋都能让我收获全新的启发。 

可别想着在我这儿耍什么诈骗的小伎俩！我可机灵着呢！遇到拿捏不准的事儿，我就爱向这些“智囊团”老教授们取取经，有他们的经验加持，一般的小套路可糊弄不了我。 

更多未说完的话、未分享的故事，咱们就留到博客里慢慢唠吧！哈哈！
