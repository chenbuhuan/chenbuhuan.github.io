Greetings! Dear friends! I'm Chen Buhuan. As for my given name, I'd like to maintain an air of mystery for now. Welcome to my personal website. Come September 2025, I will commence my pursuit of a Ph.D. in Statistics at Beijing Normal University. 

Creating this personal website has been a long-anticipated aspiration of mine. In the past, due to insufficient content reserves and time constraints, the plan remained in abeyance. Going forward, I am committed to meticulously curating this digital space. On one hand, it will serve as a chronicle of my academic journey, capturing the nuances of my research endeavors. On the other hand, I aim to make the theoretical knowledge and technical methodologies I acquire publicly accessible. This practice not only facilitates my own review but also extends the benefits to a broader audience. After all, documenting learned material is an effective means of reinforcing comprehension and retention. 

Should you find my research intriguing, I warmly invite you to reach out via email. I eagerly anticipate engaging in intellectual exchanges with you. However, if your intention is merely to engage in unproductive debates, I must kindly ask you to refrain. I am not adept at confrontational discussions, and such exchanges invariably leave me feeling drained. 

I look forward to delving into them with you through my blog. Let the conversations begin! 



您好！朋友！我是陈不奂，至于原名，就先保留这份神秘感啦~这是我的个人主页。自2025年9月起，我即将在北京师范大学攻读统计学博士学位。 

搭建这个个人主页，是我长久以来的心愿。此前，因缺乏内容积累与充足时间，计划一直搁置。未来，我会用心经营这个空间：一方面，想借此记录科研生活的点滴；另一方面，也希望将所学的理论知识、技术方法开源共享，既方便自己随时查阅，也能让更多人受益——毕竟，把学到的东西记录下来，也是巩固知识的好方法。 

倘若您对我的研究感兴趣，欢迎通过Email与我联系，我十分期待与您交流探讨！不过，要是您只想来“抬杠”，那还请绕道而行~我并不擅长争论，每次争论过后都会感到疲惫不堪。  

更多未说完的话、未分享的故事，咱们就留到博客里慢慢唠吧！哈哈！
